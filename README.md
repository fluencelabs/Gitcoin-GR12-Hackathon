# Gitcoin-GR12-Hackathon

Welcome to another edition of the Gitcoin hackathon. We are super excited and are looking forward to you joining us for another two weeks of Web3 ideation and implementation.

## About Fluence

Fluence provides the infrastructure and tools to enable decentralized compute for applications and backends on peer-to-peer networks. Nodes in the Fluence peer-to-peer network host addressable services comprised of WebAssembly Interface Types (IT) modules. Aqua, Fluence's purpose-built distributed systems programming language, allows developers to seamlessly program distributed networks and compose hosted services into decentralized applications. As a result, the Fluence platform allows you to quickly and effectively create and implement Web3 protocols and associated governance models.

## Challenges And Prices -- USD 2,500

### Explorer/Beginner's Bounties -- 5 x USD 700

Use the [fluence js node example](https://github.com/fluencelabs/examples/tree/main/fluence-js-examples/node-example) to wrap and expose a Web3 JS/TS library of your choosing. A valid solution needs to wrap your chosen library/sdk, e.g., ethers js, expose the API to be accessible and composable by Aqua, and provide a demo/testing Aqua script that approximates the library/sdk's testing scope.

### Intermediate/Advanced Bounties -- USD 2,000

* Implement a Fluence service and Aqua workflow to enable interactive signing of arbitrary data, including transactions, with Metamask and a least one other wallet using the EIP712 standard. This challenge requires you to implement the solution as one of more Wasm modules that deploy to the network and to use Aqua to compose the service(s).

* Implement and deploy Wasm IT modules to create, manage or verify Decentralized Identity (DID) or Verifiable Credentials (VC) documents and associated linked data. An implementation using BBS+, see https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ldp-bbs2020/, would score a lot of goodwill. Document your solution and provide a max three (3) minute video presenting and demonstration your solutions and submit via a Github or GitLab repo with MIT or Apache 2.0 license.

### Best Use Of FLuence And Aqua In Your DApp -- USD 2,000

Examples include:

* Use Fluence and Aqua to power a decentralized NFT creation and storage solution using, for example, plain IPFS or NFT.storage. We are especially excited about using Fluence compute to enable dynamic NFTs.
* Use Fluence and Aqua to create a multi source DEX price oracle. Fluence compute and Aqua are uniquely suited to facilitate (cross-chain) querying and processing of streams, such as the computation of buy/sell orders and optimal order-split and routing to DExs.
* Use Fluence and Aqua to enable off-chain DAOs

## Submission Requirements

* Generously document your submission
* Provide a max three (3) minute video for Beginner challenges and a max five (5) minute video for intermediate and advanced challenges to present and demonstrate your solution
* Submit via a Github or GitLab repo with MIT or Apache 2.0 license

Judging is based on originality, functionality and completeness of the submission. In the case of multiple prizes for a given challenge, the order of submissions determines payout rank for complete and functional projects.
